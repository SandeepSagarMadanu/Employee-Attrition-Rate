# 📊Employee Attrition Analysis Report	
<br>

**📝 Overview**
* This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using machine learning and data analytics. Attrition (employee turnover) is a critical challenge for organizations, and identifying the key factors leading to attrition can help in strategic decision-making. This notebook uses real-world data to build predictive models and generate actionable insights for HR departments.

**📁 Dataset**
* The dataset contains features related to employee demographics, job roles, work environment, and compensation.

* Target variable: Attrition (Yes/No)
<br>

*Sample features:*

* Age

* Gender

* Department

* Job Role

* Monthly Income

* Years at Company

* Job Satisfaction

* Environment Satisfaction

* Work-Life Balance
<br>
  
**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis**
* Visualized distributions of key categorical and numerical features.

* Compared attrition rates across different job roles, departments, and satisfaction levels.

* Identified correlations between features using heatmaps and pairplots.
<br>
  
**⚙️ Machine Learning Models**
* Several classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest

* XGBoost

* K-Nearest Neighbors

* Support Vector Machine
<br>


**🧪 Model Evaluation**
* Each model was evaluated based on:

* Accuracy

* Precision

* Recall

* F1 Score

* Confusion Matrix

* ROC-AUC Score
<br>

**💡 Key Insights**
* High attrition was observed among employees with low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance.

* Monthly income, years at company, and overtime status were strong predictors of attrition.

* Departments like Sales and Human Resources showed higher attrition rates.
<br>

**🔚 Conclusion**
* The analysis demonstrates that machine learning can effectively identify employees at risk of attrition. These insights can help HR teams proactively address employee concerns and improve retention strategies.
<br>

**▶️ Run the Notebook**
* You can open and run the notebook in Google Colab,jupyter notebook.
<br>

**📌 Future Improvements**
* Use SHAP/LIME for model interpretability.

* Deploy a dashboard for real-time attrition prediction.

* Integrate more employee engagement metrics.
